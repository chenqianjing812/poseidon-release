Welcome to Poseidon
===================

Poseidon is an easy-to-use and efficient system architecture for large-scale deep learning.

This distribution of Poseidon uses the `Tensorflow 1.0.1 client API <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/api_docs/python/>`_.

Introduction
------------

Poseidon allows deep learning applications written in popular languages and tested on single GPU nodes to easily scale onto a cluster environment with high performance, correctness, and low resource usage. This release runs the TensorFlow 1.0.1 api on distributed GPU clusters - greatly improving convenience, efficiency and scalability over the standard opensource TensorFlow software.
